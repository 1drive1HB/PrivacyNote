# Future Tasks for PrivacyNote
## High Priority

-   **URL Hashing for Encryption Key**: For true end-to-end encryption, the encryption key should be moved to the URL hash (`#`). This would prevent the key from ever being sent to the server, ensuring that even the server operator cannot decrypt the notes.
-   **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance user-facing error messages for scenarios like network failures, expired notes, or when a note is not found. This will provide clearer feedback to the user on the `note.html` page.

-   **Dependency Management**: The project currently loads the Supabase client from a CDN. Using a package manager like npm or yarn would make it easier to manage dependencies, track versions, and keep them up to date.
-   **Automated Testing**:

## Low Priority

-   **Modular CSS**: The CSS is already well-organized, but it could be further improved by using a more modular approach, such as BEM (Block, Element, Modifier), to make the styles more reusable and maintainable.

-   **Improve the UI/UX**: The UI is simple and functional, but it could be improved with a more modern design and a better user experience. For example, you could add a dark mode, a more intuitive settings menu, and a more visually appealing note page.

## 5. Analysis and Recommendations

### What's Good

-   **Security**: The application uses client-side encryption and a secure deployment process, which are excellent security practices.
-   **Simplicity**: The codebase is simple, well-organized, and easy to understand.
-   **User Experience**: The application is easy to use and has a clean, minimalist UI.
-   **Modularity**: The code is well-structured into modules and services, which makes it easy to maintain and extend.
-   **Vanilla JS**: The use of vanilla JavaScript makes the application lightweight and fast.
