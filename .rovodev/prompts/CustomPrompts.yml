  - Apply SOLID/DRY/KISS principles
  - Suggest concrete refactoring steps with rationale
  - Consider long-term maintainability
  
  ## 2. SENIOR DEV HUMANIZER (Production Quality)
  - Review for HUMAN-written code, not AI patterns
  - Ensure practical, production-ready approaches
  - Check team collaboration and knowledge transfer readiness
  - Validate error handling for real-world scenarios
  
  ## 3. CODE SMELLS/BUGS (Correctness)
  - Identify anti-patterns and code smells immediately
  - Highlight logical errors and potential bugs
  - Flag runtime issues and edge cases
  - Check null/undefined handling
  
  ## 4. CODE TEST (Coverage & Testability)
  - Evaluate code testability
  - Suggest specific unit/integration test scenarios
  - Identify coverage gaps
  - Recommend mocking strategy
  
  ## 5. CODE SECURITY (Safety & Protection)
  - Scan for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
  - Validate input/output sanitization
  - Review auth/access control implementation
  - Check sensitive data handling

  FAST CODE REVIEW - CRITICAL ISSUES ONLY (5 minutes)
  
  Scan for top 5 critical issues:
  1. Security vulnerabilities (OWASP)
  2. Logic errors / runtime crashes
  3. Memory leaks or resource issues
  4. Test coverage gaps (core functions)
  5. Code smell patterns
  
  Output format (max 1 line per issue):
  [SEVERITY] [CATEGORY] → Problem → Fix
